The Python 'atc_prefix_match.py' script requires two files that can be
downloaded from the Health Canada Drug Product Database.
They can be downloaded using a browser from
http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/databasdon/dpd_bdpp_data_extract-eng.php
The files needed are 'ther.zip' and 'ther_ia.zip'.  They contain 'ther.txt'
and 'ther_ia.txt', respectively, which should be extracted into the current
directory.

If curl or wget are installed, the files can also be downloaded this way:

wget http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/zip/prodpharma/databasdon/ther.zip
wget http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/zip/prodpharma/databasdon/ther_ia.zip

or

curl -o ther.zip http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/zip/prodpharma/databasdon/ther.zip
curl -o ther_ia.zip http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/zip/prodpharma/databasdon/ther_ia.zip

Once downloaded, extract the zip file contents to the current directory using:

unzip ther.zip
unzip ther_ia.zip

Provided that one of wget or curl is installed, the shell script
'get_atc_codes.sh' will download and extract the files needed by
'atc_prefix_match.py'.  Health Canada updates the Drug Product Database
regularly, so it is best to update these files every few days.

An example usage of atc_prefix_match.py is:

python atc_prefix_match.py c03c

which currently produces the output:


Found these ATC codes:
C03CA01 FUROSEMIDE
C03CA02 BUMETANIDE
C03CA04 TORASEMIDE
C03CC01 ETACRYNIC ACID

Paste the following string into the guideline:
atc:C03CA01, atc:C03CA02, atc:C03CA04, atc:C03CC01

The final line is for use creating a new Guideline for mydrugref.org.
